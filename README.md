# Models Of Computation

Formally verified set of notes for the while language from Imperial College London's Models of Computation Course. All written in Lean.

It's much better to run this on a local machine. To do this, you need to have Lean installed (you can find out how to do it [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html)) and preferably VSCode. Then run 

```
$ leanproject get ezrasitorus/ModelsOfComputation
```

to get the files. Open it up using VSCode
```
$ code ModelsOfComputation
```
and then go line by line to see how the proof works.
